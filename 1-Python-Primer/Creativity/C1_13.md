# Problem Statement
Write a pseudo-code description of a function that reverses a list of n
integers, so that the numbers are listed in the opposite order than they
were before, and compare this method to an equivalent Python function
for doing the same thing.

# Solution
```
REVERSE(A)
    â–¶ running loop till center of array
    for i <- 0 to N/2
        temp <- A[i]
        A[i] <- A[N-i-1]
        A[N-i-1] <- temp
        i <- i + 1
    return A
```
