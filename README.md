# DSA Python
This repository is dedicated to all the **Exercises** found in the book "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" by *Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia and Michael H. Goldwasser*.

There are a total of 15 chapters in the book, hence there would be atleast 15 folders dedicated for every chapters' exercises.

Why am I doing this? Well let's be honest. Even if I am not doing competitive programming 24x7, I still need to keep getting better in my **prima lingua** üêç and atleast try to workout all the exercises

Like they say in the **Python Temple of Zen**: *Practice makes Python*.
